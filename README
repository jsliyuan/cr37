This is a computer-assisted proof that CR(3, 7) = 20, where CR(r, n) denotes the covering radius of Reed-Muller codes RM(r, n).


verification.cpp 

It is used to verify that the nl3 of fn10||fn6(A^{-1}x+A^-1b)+g(A^-1x) cannot achieve 21.

-g++ -o verification.out verification.cpp boolean_fun.cpp affine_trans.cpp
-./verification.out

verification_1.cpp 

It is used to determine the third-order nonlinearity of fn2||fn9+g3 cannot achieve 21.

-g++ -o verification1.out verification_1.cpp boolean_fun.cpp affine_trans.cpp
-./verification1.out

verification_2.cpp 

It is used to determine the third-order nonlinearity of fn10||fn3+g3 cannot achieve 21.
-g++ -o verification2.out verification_2.cpp boolean_fun.cpp affine_trans.cpp
-./verification2.out

ffn_distribution.cpp 

Compute F_f(r) = {homo g : nl_2(f+g) = r}, and wrtie the results into a file.

The file is ~120MB, and it takes about one day to finish.
You can use it to generate "Ffn2.txt","Ffn3.txt","Ffn9.txt","Ffn10.txt",
